# Holistika Canonical Articulation Model (HCAM)

> The **enterprise ontology** of Holistika — the entity-and-relationship tier of the
> Semantic Layer. It declares, for every canonical artifact type, **what it is** (entity
> catalog) and **how it links** (a closed ArchiMate verb set + a valid-triple registry).
> HCAM is the missing semantic layer of the three-tier Data Architecture (T1 git CSV →
> T2 Supabase → **T3 Neo4j**); together they form the **Digital Twin of the Organization
> (DTO)** — "the Singularity". Research base (168 sources):
> `docs/wip/intelligence/canonical-articulation-model-2026-06-05/`.

## 1. Purpose

Holistika has ~33 canonical artifact types, each with internal layers, that must link to
each other. Without a model, links accrete ad hoc (one FK column per CSV; one Neo4j edge
per initiative — the same whole-part relationship forked into `PARENT_OF` /
`PROGRAM_PARENT_OF` / `TOPIC_PARENT_OF`). HCAM sets the **bar**: one entity catalog, one
closed verb set, one governed valid-triple registry. CSVs stay SSOT (T1); Neo4j is the
projection (T3); HCAM is the metamodel above both.

## 2. The two registries (SSOT)

| Registry | Role | Validator |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `dimensions/ENTITY_CATALOG.csv` | 33 canonical types → ArchiMate aspect + Zachman cell + SSOT + Neo4j label + owning area | `scripts/validate_canonical_articulation.py` |
| `dimensions/CANONICAL_RELATIONSHIP_REGISTRY.csv` | valid `(source_type, verb, target_type)` triples = an ISO/IEC 39075:2024 GQL *graph type* | (same; wired into `validate_hlk.py`) |

Pydantic SSOT: `akos/hlk_canonical_articulation.py`.

## 3. The closed verb set (ArchiMate-grounded)

`composition` · `aggregation` · `assignment` · `realization` · `serving` · `access` ·
`influence` · `triggering` · `flow` · `specialization` (+ `association` last-resort).

- **Intra-type layers** (process project→activity→task; role seniority; topic/area/program
  trees) = **composition**. One recursive verb — collapses the three forked `*_PARENT_OF`.
- **Inter-type links** = the dependency/dynamic verbs (assignment, realization, serving,
  influence, triggering, flow).
- Each verb maps to one **unified Neo4j edge** (`VERB_TO_NEO4J_EDGE`) — pre-wires the I91
  graph unify (I95 P2/C): forked edges migrate to the verb taxonomy; node labels disambiguate.

## 4. Layers (intra-type hierarchies)

Recursive parent-child (`item_parent_*_id`, `reports_to`, topic parent). For traversal at
scale use bridge-table or pathstring patterns (Kimball/MDM); shared-ownership (a node with
two parents, e.g. an initiative in two programs) is allowed via multiple `aggregation`
triples. Stable IDs survive renames (APQC element-ID pattern).

## 5. Ownership — Data-federated (D-IH-95-A)

| Seat | HCAM responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| **CDO** | Accountable; chairs the **Semantic Council** |
| **Data Architect** | Authors HCAM (entity catalog + verb taxonomy) |
| **Data Governance Lead** | Owns `CANONICAL_RELATIONSHIP_REGISTRY` (masterdata relationship management) |
| **Data Steward** | Operational triple stewardship |
| **AI Engineer / System Owner** | Neo4j graph platform (T3) |
| **8 area reps** | Federate their area's concept definitions |

**Wired into existing Governance (reuse, not parallel):** cross-area changes ratify via
`DECISION_REGISTER`; the council operates as a governed process (`process_list` + SOP-META);
per-area concepts flow through the area-governance methodology with **area-completeness v3
(articulation completeness)** as the acceptance check; actions in `OPS_REGISTER`; HCAM
registered in `CANONICAL_REGISTRY` across the Data three-tier architecture. People/Compliance
keeps the area-governance **methodology** (distinct from HCAM). *Semantic Council stand-up +
its SOP land in I95 P3/E.*

## 6. Competency questions (acceptance test)

1. Which processes is role R assigned to, and which capabilities do those realize?
2. What serves engagement E end-to-end, back to the roles that perform it?
3. If capability C is retired, which areas/roles/engagements are impacted?
4. Show process P's full layer path (project → … → task).
5. Is every canonical in area A wired (no orphans; valid triples only)?

ArchiMate **derivation** (weakest-link) answers Q1–Q3 without modeling every hop.

## 7. Stewardship cadence

Quarterly review aligned with the area-completeness sweep (same cadence as `SEMANTIC_LAYER.md`).
New triples: draft `status=planned` → Semantic Council review → `active` on operator-approved
tranche → projected to Neo4j on next sync (parity-checked).

## 8. Cross-references

- Semantic Layer (metrics tier): `SEMANTIC_LAYER.md`
- Data Architecture (T1/T2/T3): `DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Graph projection: `akos/hlk_graph_model.py`; graph rework: I91
- Research base: `docs/wip/intelligence/canonical-articulation-model-2026-06-05/` (brainstorm + master-synthesis + DG findings; 168-source ledger)
- Decisions: `D-IH-95-A` (model), `D-IH-95-B` (catalog + verbs + triples)

## Evidence base

**Internal:** the fork in `hlk_graph_model.py`; `process_list.item_granularity` layers; the
existing `SEMANTIC_LAYER.md` + `DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`; the Data roster (Architect/Governance
Lead/Steward "masterdata relationship management").

Group); ISO/IEC 39075:2024 GQL graph types; TOGAF content metamodel; Zachman coverage lattice;
DAMA-DMBOK metadata management; data-mesh federated computational governance; DTO / enterprise
knowledge graph (Gartner); APQC 5-level decomposition. Full ledger: 168 sources.
